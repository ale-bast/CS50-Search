# CS50-Search
## Overview

This is a simple front-end project that replicates Google's search interface. Users can enter search queries, and upon submitting the form, they will be redirected to Google's search results page with their query.

## Project Details

The Google Search Front-End consists of the following pages:

### 1. Google Search Page
- **File:** `index.html`
- **Description:** This page replicates Google's main search page. Users can type their search query and click the "Google Search" button. Their query is sent to Google's search route as a GET parameter.

### 2. Google Image Search Page
- **File:** `image.html`
- **Description:** Similar to the Google Search page, this page allows users to perform an image search. When users enter a query and click the "Google Search" button, they are redirected to Google's image search results with the query as a parameter.

### 3. Google Advanced Search Page
- **File:** `advanced.html`
- **Description:** This page simulates Google's advanced search page, allowing users to specify various search parameters, such as "all these words," "this exact word or phrase," and "any of these words." The form sends data to Google's search route with the appropriate GET parameters.

## How It Works

1. Open the desired HTML file (e.g., `index.html`, `image.html`, or `advanced.html`) in a web browser.

2. On the page, you will see a search input field and a "Google Search" button.

3. Enter your search query in the input field.

4. Click the "Google Search" button.

5. You will be redirected to Google's search results page with your query as a GET parameter in the URL.
